As per wikipedia, the defination of machine learning is "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Yeah it is too technical, let's try to break it down in simple terms with an example.

Let's imagine you are a robot, not that you are one, now go back to your childhood, as an infant you knew nothing about this world forget about world you didn't even know how to speak, walk, run and as you grow up you became aware of that but still didn't know how to ride a bicycle, motorcycle or a car for that matter.

All those thing you had to learn, right. so let's say you are learning to speak, the speaking is your task T, your performance in that, which is P, is considered as how well you are able to share communicate with other person and explain your ideas or thoughts, and as you would have noticed the more you practice it or in other terms the more experience, which is E, you have, your performance P increases and you can communicate with other and explain things, that you know or think of, very easily.

you can consider the same scenario for learning to walk, where walking is the task T and how well you walk is you performance P and the more you experience, E, you have in your childhood the better you become in that.

While the fundamentals remain same you can notice that not every task is same, the process you follow unconsciously to learn riding bike will be different from learning to drive a car and that will be different from learning to identify individual who are family and who are not. Simillary even in Machine learning we have different type of learning for certain type of tasks.

And at the same time, it's not like machine learning algorthms are 100% accurate. Even though you are walking or speaking or riding bike since the time you had learnt, you still sometime trip while walking, or fumble while speaking or fall off from you bike.

We will be covering different type of machine learning in the next post.
Till then happy learning!!
