##Welcome to StudyML.  
The thought behind creating this platform to share my knowledge about the Machine Learning and AI with everyone and at the same time demystify the Machine Learning and AI. 
Over the last couple of years, you must have heard how ML and AI will take over and how the jobs might go away because of it. We all worry about the AI apocalypse, AI takeover, Skynet. Some renowned public figures have also expressed their concern with AI and some, on the other hand, have embraced the AI power as a tool to provide better services and solve human problems which otherwise could take years of research and resources. 
 
In my view, we seem to have a give and take the relationship between human Intelligence and AI, we give data to AI to make it better and take the output of AI and use for further our benefits. Remember an AI system is as good as the data it has access to.  
 
And at the same time, while AI threat might be real it is quite far away. We are still dodging with solving on how to add empathy, passion and more human-like features in AI. I would say, it is still in the infant stage and learning from data around it. And just like any human infant, the better the environment the better human being they will be and as for AI the better the data, the better and beneficial, they will be to help solve human problems. 
 
Coming back to taking away jobs, we know about industrial revolution that occurred and we had the same fear in that era as well and yes some have lost their livelihood in that. But looking back, you can see how much it has benefitted us. People have learned to work with the machine, hence making them more efficient and productive. 
So if you are worried about your jobs, I would say ride the AI tide and reskill yourself.

I for myself have started learning about Machine Learning, AI, Data science over the last year, June 2016 to be exact. 
To give a little background about me. I was a 6 pointer in my graduation, post that struggled for 6 months to get a job, started as manual tester in 2013 with almost no coding exprience and yet here I am. 

So believe me when i say, you can do it too. Happy Learning!!
